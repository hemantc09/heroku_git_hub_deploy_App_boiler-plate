Do you wanna build a react app and deploy on heroku live and stuck where to start and what are the set up needed?

Follow steps:

download repo and save and go to that folder from command line: git@github.com:hemantc09/heroku_git_hub_deploy_App_boiler-plate.git


I have created a simple boiler plate. It has,
1. React Se
2. Git hub set
3. Heroku set

Follow steps.
- GIT HUB:
1. Create git hub repo [https://github.com/new]
2. Set up a origin remote URL : git remote set-url origin https://lnkd.in/gV43hke [more details: https://lnkd.in/gagFKFQ]
3. Add and commit and push the code. [more details: https://lnkd.in/gEVPbid]
4. Check if the code is pushed on git hub . Just for double check.
// [all done with with GitHub]

- HEROKU:
1. Create heroku app: https://lnkd.in/gFKw3Kn
2. push the code to heroku : [you will get the push URL when you create the heroku app]
3. It will take time to build the heroku app
4. Yahoooo!!! you all done
5. Open the heroku app

Check my git hub repo here: https://lnkd.in/gnZ7tcR

Note: above set up is all ready . You don't need to worry about any dependency for git hub and heroku if you follow exact steps
I struggled and I found the perfect solution above for beginners.
